### **Why?**
the time sink of social media

the main mode or participating is reacting rather than creating

### **Where?**
Next was to decide on how to implement this site. The options were: 
- basic html/css
- cms/website builders (wix/wordpress)
- static-site generators

**The Options I Didn't Use and Why**

Wix: The appeal of Wix was that it offered CMS features but upon learning more about other options I realized databases weren't something that was required and was more than I needed for this site.

HTML/CSS: The next option was creating from scratch with basic html/css. 

Gatsby: After comparing Gatsby and Jekyll I learned Gatsby would require a little more time to learn including React components and GraphQL compared to Jekyll which only required me to learn a bit of Markdown. 

**What I Did Choose and Why**

The Winner: **Jekyll**

I had no experience with Jekyll before this and after installing I was able to make changes and easily create this site and get it up and running in a couple of days.

#### How?

These instructions are using Windows 10.

**Installing Ruby**

**Installing Git**

**Installing Jekyll**

1. open a new command prompt (run as administrator)

2. cd to the location you want to create your new directory where all your files will be created

3. create a new jekyll site
> jekyll new "nameofdirectory"

Note: when I first ran this code I got an error and after some googling I came across this fix and it worked for me.

**Editing Pages**



When creating a new site the 'minima' theme is already applied which worked for me. I didn't want to worry about the design as much as the structure of my site so I didn't mess with any styling. It is possible to create any style you would like or to use themes that have already been made by others and are availabe to use.

**Pushing to Github**

**Pushing Changes and New Pages**

Whenver you add new page or make any changes and are ready to show them on your published site you just need to run these commands and they will be live:

It should take just a few seconds for any changes to show up on your published site.

> git add .

> git commit -m "new commit"

> git push origin gh-pages

<br>
Your site is now published and ready to gain an audience. There are many more features that I didn't cover including creating your own style or using already made themes. If that's something you would like to do I recommend these sites to learn more:

This is a space for me to foster creativity and knowledge where I can share writings, works in progress, programming projects, music + art, and any other things I find myself falling into. Feel free to look around.


### More About This Space
The two reasons for creating my own space:

- creation instead of reaction<br>
- sharing knowledge
